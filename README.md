# Automatic YouTube Shorts Generator and Uploader

## Background

I had the initial idea that content between platform is very transformative. A lot of Youtube's content could be transformed into TikTok content, Instagram to Facebook, Reddit to YouTube, etc. I decided to start with a slice of this idea. Reddit to Youtube. I chose to make the videos in Youtube shorts format since it's a new field, less established, more likely to gain following.

At the same time, I wanted to work with automated video editing and learning to manage code in a more pythonic way.

## Installation

### Conda

Conda the easiest way to install the dependencies for this project. If you don't have conda already, follow this tutorial for [Linux/Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH0E7FIHyQo), or this one for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCvgyvBFjyM).

If you're unfamiliar, conda allows us manage package dependencies needed in a contained format, thus won't clash with other projects' dependencies.

After you've install conda, create the conda environment needed for this project via:

```pwsh
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```

From there, if successfully installed, you'll be able to access the environment via:

```pwsh
conda activate shorts-gen
```

### Manual pip install

Alternatively, you can manually download FFmpeg and pip install all the packages needed in your desired virtual environment manager. To install FFmpeg, see [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+ffmpeg+on+mac+%2F+windows+10+%2F+linux). Here are the manual pip installs:

```pwsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up

1. Edit `config.py` to your desired settings. You'll input your Reddit API information here. Follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/NRgfgtzIhBQ?t=50) on how to set up the Reddit's API.

2. Next you'll need to set up the YouTube side of things. Follow [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/aFwZgth790Q) on how to set up YouTube Data 4 API to obtain your unique `client_secrets.json` file. Place this file in the same directory as to `main.py`.

>Note: To get the ability to make your videos public, your program has to go through an audit process. Check out this: <https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form>

### How to run

You should now be all set to run the script! Simply type `python main.py` into your terminal. It should download a relevant video, edit it, and upload it all in one step.

If you're super new to coding/python, and don't know how to run a script by `python main.py`, then right-clicking on `main.py` file and running it using `open with` and python's launcher should do the trick.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to start a pull request! (and maybe join the server so it's easier to communicate :)

### Updates

2023-10-23:
Added ability to install dependencies  via a conda `.yml` file.
Added ability to uploaded videos as is from Reddit, without rendering.

Google's authentication has changed, and now it's much harder to authenticate through the terminal. I recommend using a computer with a user interface to authenticate and run the program! So, imo, don't bother with EC2, and just use an old/spare laptop if you have one.
